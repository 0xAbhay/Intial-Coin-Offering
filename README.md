# Sample Hardhat Project

Each holder of a non-fungible token (NFT) would receive 10 ICT tokens. In the absence of an NFT, a regular user would need to pay 0.001 ether to acquire a single token. The maximum supply for the token is set at 5000. The contract has been deployed on the Sepolia test network.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
